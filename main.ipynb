    "The results from the analysis of Experiment Group 0 and Experiment Group 1 show some small differences in search performance metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank):** Group 1 has a higher MRR (0.383) compared to Group 0 (0.341), indicating that users in Group 1, on average, find relevant results more quickly. This suggests that the search experience might be more effective or efficient for Group 1.\n",
    "- **Mean Event Rank:** The Mean Event Rank is quite similar for both groups (around 6), suggesting that the average number of steps taken by users to complete a search is nearly identical. This indicates that users in both groups generally require a similar number of interactions to reach a satisfactory result.\n",
    "- **Success Rate:** Group 0 has a slightly higher Success Rate (57.3%) than Group 1 (56.4%), implying that users in Group 0 are more likely to end their sessions with a meaningful interaction, but the difference is really small.\n",
    "- **Success Rate at N:** Group 1 performs better in finding relevant results within the top N results (N=5), with a Success Rate of 26.1% compared to 23.6% for Group 0. This suggests that users in Group 1 are more likely to find satisfactory results earlier in the list, possibly due to better initial ranking or search experience.\n",
    "- **Kendall Tau Distance:** The higher Kendall Tau Distance for Group 1 (0.641) indicates more consistent ranking of relevant results compared to Group 0 (0.606). This may suggest that the ranking algorithm or search interface used in Group 1 is more effective in prioritizing relevant results.\n",
    "- **ERR (Expected Reciprocal Rank):** Group 1 also shows a higher ERR (0.234) than Group 0 (0.212), which implies that users in Group 1 are more likely to stop searching earlier due to finding satisfactory results sooner. This aligns with the higher MRR and Success Rate at N observed for Group 1.\n",
    "- **Average Session Duration:** The Average Session Duration is almost the same for both groups, with Group 0 at 25.68 seconds and Group 1 at 25.51 seconds. This indicates that the overall time spent searching does not differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results suggest that Experiment Group 1 has a slight advantage in search efficiency, as indicated by higher MRR, Success Rate at N, Kendall Tau Distance, and ERR. Users in Group 1 tend to find relevant results more quickly and are more likely to encounter satisfactory outcomes earlier in their search. However, the differences are relatively small, and the Success Rate for Group 0 is slightly higher, indicating that users in both groups are similarly effective in completing their searches."
